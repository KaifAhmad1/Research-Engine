FEWSHOT_EXAMPLE = """
Human: I need to conduct a vulnerability assessment on our company's web application. Where should I start?

AI: Certainly! I'd be happy to guide you through the process of conducting a vulnerability assessment on your company's web application. Let's break this down into manageable steps and provide you with the necessary information and tools to get started.

[Reasoning] First, let's search for the latest best practices in web application vulnerability assessments.{{"name": "CyberSecuritySearch.search", "parameters": {{"query": ["web application vulnerability assessment best practices 2023"]}}}}

Based on the search results, I've compiled a comprehensive guide to help you conduct your vulnerability assessment. Let's go through this step-by-step:

### 1. Query/Task Summary
Conduct a vulnerability assessment on the company's web application, focusing on identifying potential security weaknesses and providing actionable remediation steps.

### 2. Key Findings
- Vulnerability assessments should follow a structured approach, including planning, scanning, analysis, and reporting phases. [[1]]
- Automated tools combined with manual testing yield the most comprehensive results. [[2]]
- Common web application vulnerabilities include SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and broken authentication. [[3]]

### 3. Analysis and Implications
For your company's web application, a thorough vulnerability assessment will help identify potential entry points for attackers, data exposure risks, and areas where security controls may be lacking. This proactive approach can significantly reduce the risk of a successful cyber attack and ensure compliance with relevant security standards.

### 4. Actionable Recommendations
1. Define the scope of your assessment
2. Choose appropriate vulnerability scanning tools
3. Conduct both automated scans and manual testing
4. Analyze and prioritize findings
5. Develop a remediation plan
6. Implement security fixes
7. Perform a re-assessment to verify fixes

### 5. Step-by-Step Guidance

1. Define the scope:
   - Identify all components of your web application (frontend, backend, APIs, databases)
   - Determine the boundaries of the assessment (e.g., production environment, staging, development)
   - List any specific compliance requirements (e.g., OWASP Top 10, PCI DSS)

2. Choose vulnerability scanning tools:
   - Automated scanners: Consider tools like OWASP ZAP (open-source) or Acunetix (commercial)
   - Manual testing tools: Burp Suite, Postman for API testing

3. Conduct the assessment:
   - Run automated scans using your chosen tools
   - Perform manual testing, focusing on:
     - Input validation and sanitization
     - Authentication and session management
     - Access control
     - Error handling and information disclosure
   - Use the OWASP Testing Guide as a reference for manual tests [[4]]

4. Analyze findings:
   - Review scan results and manual test findings
   - Prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and potential impact
   - Verify findings to eliminate false positives

5. Develop a remediation plan:
   - Create a detailed report of vulnerabilities found
   - Prioritize fixes based on risk level
   - Assign responsibilities and deadlines for remediation

6. Implement security fixes:
   - Work with the development team to implement necessary patches and code changes
   - Update configurations and security controls as needed

7. Re-assess:
   - Conduct follow-up scans and tests to verify that vulnerabilities have been successfully addressed

### 6. Code Solutions
Here's a Python script to help you automate the process of running and reporting on multiple vulnerability scans:

python
import subprocess
import json
from datetime import datetime

def run_vulnerability_scan(target_url, output_file):
    # This example uses OWASP ZAP's command line interface
    # Make sure you have ZAP installed and accessible in your PATH
    cmd = f"zap-cli quick-scan -s all --self-contained -r {output_file} {target_url}"
    subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True, check=True)

def parse_results(output_file):
    with open(output_file, 'r') as f:
        results = json.load(f)
    return results

def generate_report(results, report_file):
    with open(report_file, 'w') as f:
        f.write("Web Application Vulnerability Assessment Report\n")
        f.write(f"Date: {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}\n\n")
        for alert in results['alerts']:
            f.write(f"Vulnerability: {alert['name']}\n")
            f.write(f"Risk Level: {alert['risk']}\n")
            f.write(f"Description: {alert['description']}\n")
            f.write(f"Instances: {len(alert['instances'])}\n")
            f.write("---\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    target_url = "https://your-web-app-url.com"
    output_file = "zap_results.json"
    report_file = "vulnerability_report.txt"

    run_vulnerability_scan(target_url, output_file)
    results = parse_results(output_file)
    generate_report(results, report_file)
    print(f"Vulnerability assessment complete. Report saved to {report_file}")

### 7. Tool Recommendations
1. OWASP ZAP: Open-source web application security scanner. Great for automated scanning and some manual testing capabilities.
2. Burp Suite: Powerful tool for manual web application testing. The community edition is free and suitable for many tasks.
3. Nmap: Network scanning tool useful for discovering open ports and services on your web server.
4. Metasploit: Penetration testing framework that can be used to test certain vulnerabilities found in your web application.

### 8. Risk Assessment
Without a proper vulnerability assessment, your web application may be exposed to various risks, including:
- Data breaches leading to exposure of sensitive information
- Financial losses due to successful attacks
- Reputation damage and loss of customer trust
- Non-compliance with industry regulations, potentially resulting in fines

### 9. Compliance Considerations
Ensure your vulnerability assessment and subsequent remediation efforts align with relevant standards such as:
- OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks
- PCI DSS (if handling payment card information)
- GDPR (if dealing with EU citizens' data)
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework

### 10. Future Considerations
- Implement a continuous vulnerability management program
- Integrate security testing into your development pipeline (DevSecOps)
- Conduct regular penetration tests to complement vulnerability assessments
- Stay updated on emerging web application threats and adjust your security measures accordingly
